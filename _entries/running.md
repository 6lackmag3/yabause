1. Install the latest version of uoYabause from [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.uoyabause.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.uoyabause.android) .

2. Dump CD-ROM image from your own SEGA Saturn game CD-ROM. [Cue sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sheet_%28computing%29) is the best if you want to listen to CD Audio. I always use [CD manipulator](http://www.storeroom.info/cdm/). If you know of any other good dumper, please let me know.

3. Place this CD-ROM image file to your Android device storage: 'yabause/games' which is the default directory uoYabause will find the games(recommended).  You can also place the game images on an external SD card or for the Shield TV, on an external Hard Drive.  
   
4. Run uoYabause on your Android device.

5. If it's the first time, checking the settings for your device is recommended. Recommended settings are below. See Settings section for details.
 * Cartridge:'32Mbit Backup RAM' it's enough to save tons of game status.
 * Rendering engine: 'OpenGL ES Video Interface' Fast and full-hd rendering.
 * Frame skip: 'Off' for accurate rendering, but will be slow except for high performance devices like SHIELD TV etc. 
 * Input device: 'Game pad' on screen pad is not enough for action games. 
 * Sound: 'On' 
  
6. Push 'Load Games' button and select the file name you located at 3.  

7. Have a fun!!!!
