1. Install the latest version of uoYabause from [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.uoyabause.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.uoyabause.android) .

2. Dump CD-ROM image from your own SEGA Saturn game CD-ROM. [Cue sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sheet_%28computing%29) is the best if you want to listen to CD Audio. I always use [CD manipulator](http://www.storeroom.info/cdm/). If you know other good dumpper, please let me know.

3. place this CD-ROM image file to your Android device's storage. 'yabause/games' which is the default directoy uoyabause recginaize game is recomanded.
   
4. Run uoYabause on your Android device.

5. if it's the first time, setting for your device is recomannded. Recomanded setting is below. See Settings section for details.
 * Cartrice:'32Mbit Backup RAM' it's enough to save tons of game status.
 * Rendering engine: 'OpenGL ES Video Interface' Fast and full-hd rendering.
 * Frame skip: 'Off' for acurate rendring, but be slow excepting high perfomance devices like SHEILD TV etc. 
 * Input device: 'Game pad' on screen pad is not enough for action games. 
 * Sound: 'On' 

  
6. push 'Load Games' button and select the file name you located at 3.
